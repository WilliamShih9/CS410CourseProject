The application can be assessed at http://williamshih9.pythonanywhere.com/

To get the application locally, download the "Project Application" folder, which will take a lot of time. Activate the virtual environment in that folder. This is "venv\Scripts\activate" on Windows. Then, download all of the requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then type "python -m flask" and the application should be running.
Also, read the documentation if deemed necessary.
